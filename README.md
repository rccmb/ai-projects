# Artificial Intelligence 24/25 - Projects

Projects were built using Common Lisp & LispWorks

## Project 1

The first project consists of optimally solving a Adji-boto game state where there are no players, the following algorithms were implemented:

• BFS

• DFS

• A*

• SMA*

You can view the project specifications [here](projeto1.pdf).

## Project 2

The second project consists of implementing a "computer" player, where the Adji-boto game can be played "human vs computer" or "computer vs computer":

• Negamax with α-β pruning.

You can view the project specifications [here](projeto2.pdf).
